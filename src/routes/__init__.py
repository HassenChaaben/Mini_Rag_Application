# The __init__.py file marks a directory as a Python package, 
# allowing you to import modules from that folder.
# Without it (in Python versions before 3.3), 
# Python would not recognize the folder as a package. 
# Even in modern Python,
# it's often used to run package initialization code or 
# define what gets imported with from package import *.
